<h2 class="title"> About Me </h2>

<p> 
I was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  When I was five years old my dad took a job in Bettendorf, Iowa and I've been stuck in Iowa ever since.  
I have one younger sister named Chelsea.  We both graduated high school from Pleasant Valley High School.  I played tennis for the high school team 
and played basketball everyday.  I started my working career with a lawn mowing business with a friend when we were twelve years old.  I then became 
a baseball umpire when I was fourteen years old. When I turned sixteen I started working at a Suzuki car dealership as a detailer until I
graduated high school and moved away for college.  After six months in college I took a position with Northwest Airlines who eventually merged 
with Delta Airlines for which I currently work.  I enjoy traveling and have been very fortunate with the opportunites provided by my employer. </p>

<p>
I am currently a senior MIS major. I have become very accustomed to my flight benefits working for the airlines.  I am hoping to move to a position
in either Delta or another major airlines IT department.  One of my favorite hobbies is snowboarding and I would like to be able to travel to as
many different winter destinations around the world as possible.  </p>
